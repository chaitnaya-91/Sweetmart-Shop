cors  :-

In a React project, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is not something React directly handles, but it's very important when your React app (frontend) tries to make requests to a backend API hosted on a different origin (i.e., different domain, protocol, or port).

üö´ Problem Without CORS:
If your React app (e.g., running on http://localhost:3000) tries to fetch data from a backend server at http://localhost:5000, the browser blocks the request due to same-origin policy ‚Äî unless the backend explicitly allows it.
